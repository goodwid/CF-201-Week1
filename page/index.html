    <h1>David Goodwin</h1>
    <h2>Biography</h1>
    <p class = "biography">I have lived in Oregon my whole life, though I was born elsewhere.
    I stumbled into a career in IT support out of a lack of any other marketable skills
    and a desire to avoid work that requires heavy lifting or getting dirty.  I suspect that if 20s
    David knew that servers were really heavy it might have gone differently.</p>
