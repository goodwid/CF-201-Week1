        <h2>Biography</h1>
        <p class = "biography">I have lived in Oregon my whole life, though I was born elsewhere.
        I stumbled into a career in IT support out of a lack of any other marketable skills
        and a desire to avoid work that requires heavy lifting or getting dirty.  I suspect that if 20s
        David knew that servers were really heavy it might have gone differently.</p>
